% expected across the spectrum.'upen' can be very slow.
% 'mg' is not a conventional regularization, but rather uses non-linear
% regression to fit a spectrum of relaxation time constants with a number of 
% guassian-shaped components in the log-time-constant domain. Because it is
% a non-linear fitting, initial estimates for time-constants can be supplied
% (fitting.T0guass) or will be generated automatically. Also, to avoid
